what is git :-
1) git is source code management system is use to manage the source code 
2) source control refers to manage the history of changes in the codebase
3) it can also track the changes in the codebase.
4) scm can use to resolve the conflict which is created by developers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Source Control Is Important:- 
1) When multiple developers are working within a shared codebase it is a common occurrence to make edits to a shared piece of code. 
2) Separate developers may be working on a seemingly isolated feature, however this feature may use a shared code module. 
3) Therefore developer 1 working on Feature 1 
4) could make some edits and find out later that Developer 2 working on Feature 2 has conflicting edits
5) Developers would edit text files directly and move them around to remote locations using FTP or other protocols. 
6) Developer 1 would make edits and Developer 2 would unknowingly save over Developer 1’s work and wipe out the changes.

Advantages og SCM 
 Distributed Version Control:
 1) Git is a distributed version control system, meaning each developer has a complete copy of the entire repository, 
    including its history.
 2) This enables developers to work offline and independently, making collaboration more flexible.

Branching and Merging:
 1) Git makes it easy to create branches for different features or bug fixes.
 2) Developers can work on their tasks in isolation, and later merge their changes back into the main codebase. 

History Tracking:
 1) Git maintains a detailed history of changes made to the codebase. 
 2)
